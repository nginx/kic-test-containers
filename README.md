## KIC Test Containers

This repository contains the Dockerfiles and code for the test containers used in the [Kubernetes Ingress Controller](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress).

### Building the containers for local testing
For each container, run the following command from the root of the repository:
```
docker build -t <container-name> -f <container-type>/Dockerfile .
```


Alternatively, you can use the `Makefile` to build the containers. For example, to build the `grpc-server` container, run the following command from the root of the repository:
```
make grpc-server
```

### Publishing the containers
The containers are published to the [NGINX GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/nginxinc/packages?repo_name=kic-test-containers) when a new tag is created in this repository. You can see the packages on the right side of this page.
